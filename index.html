    			<h1>Idea:</h1>
    			<p>A site that helps people find local things to do at night. 
  				<p>I often find myself sitting at home asking my wife if there is anything to do tonight. We love going to bars to play trivia or karaokee, but it's difficult to find places that are hosting those type of events each night. 
					</p>
					<p>Unless you are already fully in tune with your local community, it's hard to know what is happening in your are each night.</p>
					<p>I have talked to other people about this problem and they have expressed similar pain. Sites like Yelp and Foursquare are great to get reviews on businesses, but they don't do a good job showing what is currently happening around you that day.
					</p>
    			<p>The goal of the site is help users find interesting events, food and drink specials near them. Lots of restaurants and bars have specials each night (happy hour, ladies night, 1/2 off food specials, etc.) and this allows people to discover those events in their community.
    			</p>
    			<h1>Execution:</h1>
    			<p>Looking to have a simple, one page MVP built with a focus on the back end and admin side. I can style the front-end so no need to go crazy with making it look perfect. Eventually users will be able to click on the event and see more details about the business as well as a calender of events for the business.
    			</p>
    			<p>I will populate the database with events and continue to do so for each day. As the site grows, users will be able to submit events themselves.
    			</p>

				<div class="container left">
	    		<section class="details">
	    			<h1>App Details</h1>
	    			<h4>Event Feed:</h4>
	    			<p>- This lists all the events near the user. For each event, the user should be able to see the type of event/special/offer as the main focus with the time that the event runs right below. At the bottom of the event's container it should have the name of the business and the distance from the user.</p>
	    			<p>- This list should just be a continuous scroll through all the events. If it's easier to paginate, that's fine too.</p>
	    			<p>- There should be a tab at the top of the feed that shows today's events as the default selection, but the user can also go back or forward a day. <span class="note">This isn't 100% necessary for MVP</span></p>
	    			<p>- For each event, the background of the container will be a picture of the business or a generic picture based on the event type (food, drink, etc.).

					<section class="details">
						<h4>Filters (may not be necessary for MVP):</h4>
						<p>- Users should be able to filter the events by event type: All, Drink specials, Food specials, special activities.</p>
						<p>- Change the distance of events that show in the feed. Default 30 miles.</p>
						<p>- Calender to see events on a certain date</p>
					</section>
					<section class="details">
						<h4>Data:</h4>
						<p>- Site admin will load data through admin page into a database. See Database notes for initial mockup</p>
						<p>- Users will use a field on the right of the page to upload any events that they believe are relevant that aren't already listed.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>User Added Events:</h4>
						<p>Users should be able to submit their own events that they know of.</p>
